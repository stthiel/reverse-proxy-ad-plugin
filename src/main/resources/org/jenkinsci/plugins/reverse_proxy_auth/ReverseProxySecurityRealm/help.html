    This setup assumes that you have a front-end reverse proxy that performs authentication,
    which sets the authenticated user domain (!) name as an HTTP header and pass it on to Jenkins.
    <p/>
    The name is expected as 'domain\user' in order to perform an update of the LDAP search base with the
    domain name.<br/>
    The rootDN of your forest should be used as this rootDN. Please do not use Global Catalog for the search -
    it will most likely fail.<br/>
    It is recommended to use 'sAMAccountName={0}' for the search.<br/>
    The search will look up 'sAMAccountName=user' in DC=domain,&lt;your rootDN&gt; and will retrieve the group
    authorities by reading the attribute 'memberOf'. In case a person is found, also 'displayName' and 'mail' are
    populated to the jenkins user.

    <p/>
    According to <a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/83067">this thread</a> and
    <a href="http://old.nabble.com/Forcing-a-proxied-host-to-generate-REMOTE_USER-td2911573.html#a2914465">this thread</a>,
    Apache configuration to do this would something like this:

<pre>
# prevent the client from setting this header
RequestHeader unset X-Forwarded-User

RewriteEngine On
# see the Apache documentation on why this has to be lookahead
RewriteCond %{LA-U:REMOTE_USER} (.+)
# this actually doesn't rewrite anything. what we do here is to set RU to the match above
RewriteRule .* - [E=RU:%1]
RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-User %{RU}e
</pre>
